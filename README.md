# Shouhizei

This gem support to calculate Japan consumption tax

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'shouhizei'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install shouhizei

## Usage

You can get Japanese consumption tax rate like below.

```ruby
Shouhizei.rate_on(Time.zone.local(1989, 3, 31))
 => (0/1)

Shouhizei.rate_on(Time.zone.local(1989, 4, 1))
 => (3/100)

Shouhizei.rate_on(Time.zone.local(1997, 4, 1))
 => (1/20)

Shouhizei.rate_on(Time.zone.local(2014, 4, 1))
 => (2/25)

Shouhizei.rate_on # Returns the current consumption tax
 => (2/25)
```

This considers local timezone and changes to `'Asia/Tokyo'` by using `ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone#in_time_zone` .

```ruby
> Time.zone = 'Asia/Tokyo'
=> "Asia/Tokyo"
> Shouhizei.rate_on(Time.zone.local(1989, 3, 31, 10, 0, 0))
=> (0/1)
> Time.zone = 'Hawaii'
=> "Hawaii"
> Shouhizei.rate_on(Time.zone.local(1989, 3, 31, 10, 0, 0)) # 1989-04-01 05:00:00 in Japan
=> (3/100)
```

Calculation tax included price.
Return value class is Integer.
```ruby
Shouhizei.included(price: 100, date: Time.zone.local(2014, 4, 1))
 => 108 # return value class is Integer
```

Configuration how to deal fraction round up or round down.
Default is round down.
```ruby
Shouhizei.config[:rounding] = Shouhizei::RoundUp
Shouhizei.included(price: 10)
 => 11
